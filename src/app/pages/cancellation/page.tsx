            Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within 2–3 days of placing the order. However, cancellation requests may not be entertained if the orders have already been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the shipping process.

          <li>
            Cancellations are not accepted for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, refund or replacement may be issued if the customer can establish that the delivered product's quality was unsatisfactory.
